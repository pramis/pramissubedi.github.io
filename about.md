# Hey, I'm Pramis! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with a passion for building meaningful technology that makes a difference. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new ideas, learning about emerging technologies, or sharing thoughts on the intersection of technology and life.

## What I Do

I work primarily in web development, focusing on creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications. My interests span across:

- **Full-stack Development** - Building end-to-end solutions
- **Modern Web Technologies** - React, Node.js, and emerging frameworks
- **Developer Experience** - Tools and processes that make development better
- **Open Source** - Contributing to the community that has given me so much

## Beyond Code

Technology fascinates me not just for what it can do, but for how it can improve people's lives. I believe in thoughtful development - taking time to understand problems deeply before jumping to solutions.
