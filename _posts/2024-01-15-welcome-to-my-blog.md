# Welcome to My Blog

After spending way too much time tweaking themes and color schemes, I'm excited to finally launch this space where I can share my thoughts on technology, development, and life. This summer I am working on launching [Machiavelli Insights] (minisghts.xyz) and want to keep a running blog of that development process and the other things I am musing over.

## What Changed

I've completely redesigned this blog with a focus on readability and simplicity. Gone is the overwhelming yellow color scheme (sorry, Hitchens theme!), replaced with a clean black and white design that you can toggle between light and dark modes. 

The inspiration came from browsing through [Dylan's blog](https://www.dylan.sh) and appreciating the clean, functional approach to personal blogging. Sometimes the best designs are the ones that get out of the way and let the content shine.

## What's Coming

I'm planning to write about:

- **Development experiences** - Both the successes and the inevitable failures
- **Technology thoughts** - New tools, frameworks, and industry trends
- **Project showcases** - Things I'm building and learning from
- **Random musings** - Because sometimes you need to think out loud

## The Technical Bits

For those curious, this blog is built with:
- **Jekyll** for static site generation
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **Custom SCSS** for the theme switching functionality
- **A lot of coffee** for the late-night coding sessions

The theme toggle in the top-right corner lets you switch between light and dark modes, and your preference is saved locally. It's a small touch, but one that makes the reading experience more comfortable.

## Let's Connect

I'd love to hear from you! Whether you want to discuss a project, share feedback on a post, or just say hello, feel free to reach out through any of the links in the [about page](/about) or connect with me on:

- **GitHub**: [@{{ site.github_username }}](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }})
- **Twitter/X**: [@{{ site.twitter_username }}](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }})
- **LinkedIn**: [Connect with me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.linkedin_username }}/)

Here's to new beginnings and the conversations that follow.
